# Arc-reactor

![Arc Reactor](https://preview.ibb.co/dFjdxH/Arc_reactor.png "Arc-Reactor: Asynchronous, Extensible, Micro web framework for Rust.")
<br/><br/>
An **Asynchronous**, **Extensible**, **Micro** web framework for Rust.

![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/arc-reactor.svg)

## Features

* **Asynchronous**. In arc reactor, Service Handlers are asynchronous by default.

* **Integration With futures-await**. The `#[service]` proc_macro not only derives the `ArcService` trait for your route handler, but also marks it as `#[async]` so you can await on futures in your route handlers with no extra stress.

* **Intuitive Middleware System**. arc reactor exposes a middleware system that is easy to reason about. Have a look at the [design spec](./DESIGN.md)

* **Minimalistic**. arc reactor is designed to be a very thin abstraction over tokio and hyper.

* **TLS Support**. easy to add tls support.

* **Opt-in to Nightly**. arc reactor uses a lot of cool features, including `proc_macros` which are only available on the nightly channel, using the `unstable` feature flag.

## Installation

Add this to your `cargo.toml`

```toml
arc-reactor = "0.1"
```

## Demo (default)

```rust
extern crate arc_reactor;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_json;
use arc_reactor::prelude::*;
use arc_reactor::{Router, ArcReactor, StatusCode};

fn main() {
  ArcReactor::new()
    .routes(rootRoutes())
     .port(3000)
     .initiate()
     .unwrap()
}

fn rootRoutes() -> Router {
  Router::new()
    .get("/", IndexRoute)
}


fn IndexRoute(_req: Request, res: Response) -> FutureResponse {
	let future = fakeFuture().then(|status| {
		match status {
			Ok(isAuth) => {
				if isAuth {
    				let payload = json!({
    			  	"data": "hello world"
    				});
    				return Ok(payload.into()) // convert json to json response.
  				}
			}
			_ => unreachable!()
		}
	});

  Box::new(future)
}

fn fakeFuture() -> impl Future<Item=bool, Error=()> {
  futures::future::ok(true)
}
```

## Demo (unstable)

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro, generators, proc_macro_non_items)] // <== need to add this.
extern crate arc_reactor;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_json;
use arc_reactor::prelude::*;
use arc_reactor::{Router, ArcReactor, StatusCode};

fn main() {
  ArcReactor::new()
    .routes(rootRoutes())
     .port(3000)
     .initiate()
     .unwrap()
}

fn rootRoutes() -> Router {
  Router::new()
    .get("/", IndexRoute)
}


#[service]
fn IndexRoute(_req: Rrequest, res: Response) {
  let isAuth = await!(fakeFuture());
  if isAuth {
    let payload = json!({
      "data": "hello world"
    });

    return Ok(payload.into()) // convert json to json response.
  }

  res.with_status(StatusCode::UnAuthorized)
}

fn fakeFuture() -> impl Future<Item=bool, Error=()> {
  futures::future::ok(true)
}
```

## Nightly Use

Originally, arc-reactor was designed for the nightly compiler.
But instabilities in `libprocmacro` cause it to break everytime a new nightly compiler is released.

So by default, arc-reactor no longer uses the nightly compiler, and will work out of the box with the stable compiler. ðŸŽ‰
This means experimental nightly features including proc_macros are only available behind the `unstable` feature flag.

If you wish to use arc-reactor, with the nightly compiler and unstable feature enabled:
It is recommended that you lock down the compiler version. Until `libprocmacro` is stablized.

If you wish to use arc-reactor with it's default features:
  - The trait `ArcService` is implemented for all functions that satisfy the signature `Fn(Request, Response) -> FutureResponse`
  - The trait `MiddleWare<Request>` is implemented for all functions that satisfy the signature `Fn(Request) -> MiddleWareFuture<Request>`
  - The trait `MiddleWare<Response>` is implemented for all functions that satisfy the signature `Fn(Response) -> MiddleWareFuture<Response>`
  - futures from futures-rs is re-exported instead of futures-await.
  - you lose the ability to `await!` on futures in your ServiceHandlers and MiddleWares.
  - Currently, Multipart support is implemented using unstable features, so you would have to implement your own.

## Examples

Check out the examples folder and the [api documentation](https://docs.rs/arc-reactor/~0.1) to get a feel for how `arc reactor` works.
<br>
It's well documented and should get you up and running in no time.

## Design
It is Strongly recommended that you read the [design](./DESIGN.md) document, as it gives you full disclosure on arc-reactor's internals,
as well as the design decisions that were made.

## Contributions
Arc-Reactor is highly extensible via middlewares which are placed in the `contrib` module.

Some of the things are missing include:
 - [] Logger
 - [] Websocket
 - [] Support byte range headers
 - [x] Asynchronous StaticFileServer
 - [x] Json body parser
 - [x] Multipart Support
